Following the Rose/Bud/Thorn model:

Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

Bud:
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also be ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future.

Thorn:
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here.

Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.
