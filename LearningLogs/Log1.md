# DSF Fall 2023 Learner Log Entry #1

## Prompts
Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn model](https://stormboard.com/blog/how-to-use-the-rose-bud-and-thorn-design-thinking-template):

The **rose/bud/thorn learning model** is a simple but powerful tool for reflection and improvement. It encourages people to identify positive aspects (roses), challenges (thorns), and opportunities (buds) in a given situation. This information can then be used to plan for the future and make changes as needed.


Here is how the **rose/bud/thorn** learning model works:


* **Identify roses**. What went well? What did you enjoy? What were you proud of?
* **Identify thorns**. What challenges did you face? What could have been done better? What did you learn from your mistakes?
* **Identify buds**. What opportunities are there for growth? What are you curious about? What new things would you like to try?

### Rose:
The highlight from the previous FOSS session, such as something you found particularly interesting. This could also be something you're excited to implement now.

### Bud:
Something that you are looking forward to digging into deeper. This could also include ideas on how to apply concepts to your research in the future.

### Thorn:
Something that was challenging that could be worked on, such as anything that wasn't 100% clear and could be elaborated on. Any sticking points should be addressed here.

### Additional thought
Write anything that you think would be important for YOU later on.
